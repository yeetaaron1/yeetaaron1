# 👋 Hi, I'm Aaron

### 👀 Interests
I'm a college student studying business and programming. Thanks to the Minecraft Java community, I've learned—and am still learning—how to code in Java, along with other skills like JavaScript, Python, and a bit of C# and C++. I’m passionate about creating Minecraft mods, plugins, addons, and resource packs (and, of course, other projects that aren’t Minecraft-related). I've also developed skills in server management. Additionally, I enjoy coding Discord bots, building websites, and developing custom APIs.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- Advanced Minecraft plugin development using the Velocity, BungeeCord, Paper (Spigot), Forge, and Fabric APIs
- Working on learning how to use Geyser to add Bedrock support to my plugins
- Learning how to use Ubuntu Linux server for my Minecraft server.
- Deepening my knowledge in Java, JavaScript, Python, Kotlin, Gradle, and Maven for more efficient development

### 💞️ Collaboration
I'm looking to collaborate on projects related to:
- Minecraft server plugins (Velocity, BungeeCord, Paper (Spigot), Forge, and Fabric)
- Minecraft Server Cross-platform gaming experiences
- Discord bot development and integration with game servers
- Website development and API creation
